Additional pickers to the original LOC-FLOW (Zhang et al., SRL, 2022)

The original EQTransformer can be found at https://github.com/smousavi05/EQTransformer
The original OBSTransformer can be found at https://github.com/alirezaniki/OBSTransformer
We provided the prediction script and training models in this directory. 
For the software installation environment, please check the instructions in the original EQT package.

Originally, we only have the "run_picker.py" file and "models" folder in this directory.

"run_picker.py" reads in the material provided in the previous step and starts the picking either by EQT or OBST. In this example, 
outputs are stored in "output" folder.

Then we convert these outputs to a REAL-friendly format (see "picks" folder) and run the "pick2real" tool to generate the final picks.

next, we go to ../REAL folder.

It should work well before the hypoDD_dtcc step.
The hypoDD_dtcc utilizes FDTCC to compute cross-correlation differential times, requiring SAC formats and specific file naming.
To simply overcome this issue, you can download the same data again using the data downloading script in origional LOC-FLOW.
